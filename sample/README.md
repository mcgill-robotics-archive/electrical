# Sample Reference Repository
I've uploaded Bei's LED Blinker tutorial board here to demonstrate how
  to use the Git repository.
I gave it its own folder so as to not clutter the rest of the 
  repository.
When looking at it, treat this folder is its own mini-repository 
  (i.e. it has its own project folder and components folder inside it).
