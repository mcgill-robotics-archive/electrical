# Tiva Module

Backplane module for the [TI TM4C123GH6PM](http://www.ti.com/product/TM4C123GH6PM). Integrates into the arm, drive, and science backplanes, as well as the power boards.

## Notes:

- Basically a custom version of [this](http://www.ti.com/tool/ek-tm4c123gxl) Launchpad Board, but with better decoupling, analog reference filtering, and no integrated debugger.

- Code can be uploaded to it from one of the TI Launchpads we purchased using the JTAG connector.
