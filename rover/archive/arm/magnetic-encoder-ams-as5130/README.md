# Magnetic Encoder

__Author:__ Steven Dahdah

__Description:__ Simple absolute magnetic encoder circuit using an ams `AS5130-ASSP`. Designed to replace the internal circuitry of our burned RLS `RM22S` encoders.

__Note:__ This is the encoder planned to be used on Bhumi's arm. Not the encoder for the third rover's arm. This part may be re-used later, but not for the third rover's arm.
