# Drive Backplane

Fred-Eric Desulme

## Instructions for Use

1 - Plug in 24V supply (the microcontrollers cannot turn on without this)

2 - Plug board in to a computer via USB (the USB hub on the board will not distribute power unless it has connected with a USB host)

If you don't want to use the 24V supply, connect a jumper between the `VBUS_IN` test pad and the `+5V` test pad.

**Note that there are two +5V lines on this board. One reserved for the servo motors, and one for the ICs on the board.**
